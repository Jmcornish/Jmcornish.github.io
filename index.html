                                The decision of where you take your pets is an ever-evolving issue, it is a relevant issue to all pet owners. The 
    issue of a truly safe play area for the dogs is complicated, 
    because most dog parks do not employ safety measures
    that protects against dog-on-dog violence. This issue is 
    even more important for puppies who may not have the 
    social experience for them to socialize between dogs. This 
    is a very serious issue because they are most likely to either 
    get injured or injure other dogs or even themselves.
